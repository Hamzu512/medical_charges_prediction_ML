# Medical Charges Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts medical insurance charges based on various factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region using **Linear Regression** in Python.

## 📌 Features
- Loads the `insurance.csv` dataset from an online source
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Data preprocessing:
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Standardizing numerical features
- Model training with `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- Predictions for new customer data

## 🛠️ Requirements
